# Micropython_MP3_Speaker
I was looking around to implement a motion based MP3 loudspeaker box to place it some corner of my bathroom so every time I enter it it plays some music.
So I came to the DFPlayer modul which I added to one of my WemosD1 Mini.
I also added a PIR sensor for motion detectin and an LDR because I don'w want the music played in the night.<BR>
So this is the elctrical setup:<BR>
